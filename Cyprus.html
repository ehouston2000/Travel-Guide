        <h1>My experience in Cyprus</h1>

            <p>I recently went to Ayia Napa, Cyprus with a group of girlfriends. It was a short but very fun trip. <br/h>
            If you're looking for short haul then Cyprus is the place for you.</p>

            <h3>Where to stay</h3>
            <p>When I went my and my friend stayed at the Sunprime Hotel, this hotel was really good and modern.<br/h>
            They have a lot of options for breakfast, including a full english
            Each block had it's own pool, and each room was a studio so if you like cooking then I would highly recommend!<br/h>

            When exploring Ayia Napa we noticed that a lot of the accomodations where within walking distance and were very similar structure.<br/h>
            So here is a list of other accomodations you may consider:</p>
